This is the code for my personal blog website.

## Technology stack
### Github
I already use Github for my public code repos.
Deploying to Github-Pages can be automated (Actions) and the hosting is free for things at this scale.

### Jekyll
This is the supported static site builder based on Ruby. I hadn't had any Ruby experience and, now that I have set this up, still haven't.
Jekyll allows me to write posts in markdown and make page layouts with snippets of html.

### Devcontainer
This pulls double-duty in saving me from having to set up my own Ruby environment from scratch while also containing the dependencies in an ephemeral environment that wont clog my personal machine.
If you don't already use devcontainers, give it a try.
