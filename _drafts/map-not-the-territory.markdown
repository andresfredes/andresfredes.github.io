An obviously true statement with interesting ramifications 
<!--more-->



... extracted from in-progress "unconventional thoughts"

If I wanted to help a friend get from their house to mine there are many ways that I could do it. For this argument, lets assume no phone or GPS options. A simple and effective approach would be to make a list of directions. It would have street names or landmarks as decision points, at which a relative direction change would also be indicated. Something like "Turn left at the first street after the clock tower". If I was feeling particularly artistic, I might instead draw a rough map with the decision points marked, and the directions implied by the mapped path. Importantly, this map and this set of directions are very limited in what information they provide.

The usefulness of a map is related to both the pertinent information being included and, importantly, as little other information. Including the name of every street between the two locations would only make the map less useful, despite, in terms of mapping to the world we live in, becoming more accurate.

The same idea holds true for the maps and models we have in our heads, but with a dangerous twist that gets people into trouble: we use our existing maps to navigate new situations. My friend would have a hard time getting to the post office using the directions to my house, so imagine the map issues from common generalisations: people I know -> everyone; my health -> someone else's; or my life -> yours.
