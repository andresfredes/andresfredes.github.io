**Important:** Humans are not cats.

Curiosity is a powerful thing. It has taken me down many rabbit holes and has been one of the core drivers of much of my learning. There is also an interesting relationship between curiosity and creativity. In many of my own creative pursuits, the creative process feels much like curiosity. Almost as if I am following my curiosity deeper into whatever part of my mind that is the creative wellspring.

During my recent move to using [my own search engine]({% post_url 2025-06-14-self-hosted-search-engine %}), the experience of search and the nature of search results suddenly changed. My understanding of internet search was the following: Back in the day, websites were indexed by companies like Google to become searchable. Keywords in the search were matched with words on the site so that when doing a search, the top results would likely be the most related to the search terms. Over time, as this system was gamed with search engine optimisation (SEO) like artificially adding lots of common search terms invisibly, to raise the website in various searches, the search engines adapted by using black-box algorithms that would assess various characteristics of a website in order to match it to the search terms. The internet grew and the SEO cat and mouse game continued until search became what it is today. This previous characterisation that I had was wrong; not in any of the specifics, but in the glaring omissions. The key omission is that Google, which has long been my primary method of search, has monitisation models built into the way that users interact with the site - advertising and data collection.

People pay Google in order to have more people visit their sites. This immediately creates a potential conflict between the goals of providing the most helpful search and the most profitable search. As the Google ecosystem has grown, the search engine has also started including more ways to increase the profitability by providing search results that direct users to other Google products to keep them within the ecosystem. The first page of a search will now have things like sponsored links, Google Maps, Google reviews and YouTube videos.

Importantly, this post is not about Google. They are just providing a well-known example of how The Algorithm shapes the things we see, hear and interact with when using the internet. Similar processes are happening with Facebook, Instagram and X feeds, with music being prioritised on Spotify, the watch next recommendations on Netflix, app recommendations in App Stores and much, much more.

So, how does this tangent about The Algorithm relate to curiosity? People are increasingly relying on these feeds and directed content experiences to actively steer the direction of their online interest. The most stark example of that is with short form video content like Tik Tok or YouTube shorts, where the method of interaction with the videos directly incentivises swiping from video to video, letting the feed provide the next engaging video and discouraging the kind of exploration or active searching that goes hand in hand with curiosity.
