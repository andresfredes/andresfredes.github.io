What do you believe that most do not?

This post started its life as a "Top 10" list, in which I presented ten, one-line summaries of ideas and beliefs I hold that I don't see to be held in the majority. From there I was going to discuss each in a bit more detail, to provide context for how I had come to each, and maybe even a little encouragement for you to consider your own position. This quickly started to unravel as I looked at my part-written post and couldn't help but see a reflection of the AI generated listacle that is one among many of the low-effort content that has been flooding the internet of late.

I should note that I write because I enjoy writing. I write publicly because I want to practice in a way that holds more accountability than if the words were all secreted away on my laptop. I do not write to engage with the attention economy and so seeing that hint there (even if unwarranted), drove me in a different direction.

So, let's start over.

I like arguing. I enjoy picking at the nuanced edges and grey areas that are an almost inevitable part of any held opinion. 

I have found that we all have a natural inclination to generalise, simplify and create mental models that explain the world and our experiences within it. This process is remarkably efficient, in that we can experience one or two cases of situation and immediately hold a strong belief about how the world works. This natural ability of ours allows us to quickly adapt to unfamiliar scenarios and learn new things quickly. Unfortunately, the patterns we see are so often wrong. Certainly not wrong in the sense of not being useful, as I will discuss in a moment, but wrong in the sense of not truly being an accurate representation of the world. 

If I wanted to help a friend get from their house to mine there are many ways that I could do it. For this argument, lets assume no phone or GPS options. A simple and effective approach would be to make a list of directions. It would have street names or landmarks as decision points, at which a relative direction change would also be indicated. Something like "Turn left at the first street after the clock tower". If I was feeling particularly artistic, I might instead draw a rough map with the decision points marked, and the directions implied by the mapped path. Importantly, this map and this set of directions are very limited in what information they provide.

The usefulness of a map is related to both the pertinent information being included and, importantly, as little other information. Including the name of every street between the two locations would only make the map less useful, despite, in terms of mapping to the world we live in, becoming more accurate.

The same idea holds true for the maps and models we have in our heads, but with a dangerous twist that gets people into trouble: we use our existing maps to navigate new situations. My friend would have a hard time getting to the post office using the directions to my house, so imagine the map issues from common generalisations: people I know -> everyone; my health -> someone else's; or my life -> yours.
