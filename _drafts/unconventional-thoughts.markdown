What do you believe that most do not?
<!--more-->

This post started its life as a "Top 10" list, in which I presented ten, one-line summaries of things that I believe that do not seem to be held in the majority. From there I was going to discuss each in a bit more detail, to provide context for how I had come to each, and maybe even a little encouragement for you to consider your own position. This quickly started to unravel as I realised I couldn't help seeing the taint of the modern internet trying to worm its way into my personal blog.

I write because I enjoy writing. I write publicly because I want to practice in a way that holds more accountability than if the words were all secreted away on my laptop. I do not write to generate traffic and I especially do not write to engage with the attention economy.

So, let's start this again.

I like arguing.

We all have a natural inclination to generalise, simplify and create mental models that explain the world and our experiences within it. This process is remarkably efficient, in that we can experience one or two cases of situation and immediately hold a strong belief about how the world works. This natural ability of ours allows us to quickly adapt to unfamiliar scenarios and learn new things quickly. Unfortunately, the patterns we see are so often wrong.

If I am making a map ... map vs territory

I enjoy picking at the nuanced edges and grey areas that are an inevitable part of any held opinion.
