What do you believe that most do not?

This post started its life as a "Top 10" list, in which I presented ten, one-line summaries of ideas and beliefs I hold that I don't see to be held in the majority. From there I was going to discuss each in a bit more detail, to provide context for how I had come to each, and maybe even a little encouragement for you to consider your own position. This quickly started to unravel as I looked at my part-written post and couldn't help but see a reflection of the AI generated listacle that is one among many of the low-effort content that has been flooding the internet of late.

I should note that I write because I enjoy writing. I write publicly because I want to practice in a way that holds more accountability than if the words were all secreted away on my laptop. I do not write to engage with the attention economy and so seeing that hint there (even if unwarranted), drove me in a different direction.

So, let's start over.

I like arguing. I enjoy picking at the nuanced edges and grey areas that are an almost inevitable part of any held opinion. 

I have found that we all have a natural inclination to generalise, simplify and create mental models that explain the world and our experiences within it. This process is remarkably efficient, in that we can experience one or two cases of situation and immediately hold a strong belief about how the world works. This natural ability of ours allows us to quickly adapt to unfamiliar scenarios and learn new things quickly. Unfortunately, the patterns we see are so often wrong. Certainly not wrong in the sense of not being useful, as I will discuss in a moment, but wrong in the sense of not truly being an accurate representation of the world.
