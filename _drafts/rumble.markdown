This is a story about rocks.

<!--more-->

As a teenager, I was fascinated with martial arts. I went to weekly training at a local dojo, spent time experimenting with how different types of movements felt, would reading books on martial arts philosophies and watched an inordinate number of B-grade Kung Fu movies.

Fast forward a couple of decades and I am fascinated with software. I work during the week as a software developer, spending my leisure time maintaining a homelab, experimenting with how different operating systems feel, and gaming.

This last week, these two different eras of my life collided.

Now for some context. Gaming on Linux has had a well-deserved reputation for being fiddly and difficult. While that reputation was deserved historically, it is definitely not the case today. The collective efforts of many clever contributors have culminated in software like the two that led to this story: [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg/) and [WiVRn](https://wivrn.github.io/). Bazzite is a gaming-flavoured version of Linux that takes all the best gaming goodies and tweaks and has baked them directly into the operating system, so that you can turn on your computer for the first time after a fresh install and be ready to dive directly into games. WiVRn is client-server software to be installed on both your gaming computer and VR headset, enabling PCVR. These two pieces of software turned my Quest 2 and my Linux-only PC into the perfect team.

This brings us to the most important character in our story, [Rumble](https://store.steampowered.com/app/890550/RUMBLE/). I will leave the descriptions of Rumble to others (see links at the end), but the key thing about it is that it is a VR game that requires incredibly precise physical movements in order to produce any effects. It turns out that playing this game feels to my body much the same as the martial arts experimentation did when I was younger, but with Anime-like effects in the virtual world to accompany a successfully executed movement.
