The first thing that surprised me about looking after a [Deinonychus Antirrhopus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinonychus), the bigger cousin to the Velociraptor, was just how low maintenance it turned out to be.

But, before I get to that, lets talk about something much less exciting: Linux.

I am not a Linux enthusiast, despite how I may come across to the people around me. For a long time, Linux has just been the least objectionable choice in a fairly sad lineup of tools that let me use a computer. My view of linux was:

### Pros:
- Doesn't try to sell me things
- Doesn't force me into technological walled gardens
- Doesn't watch, listen and record everything I do

### Cons:
- High effort
- Steep learning curve
- Random things break

The pros only amounted to a list of things I didn't like about the other systems, but the cons felt manageable enough to not put me off. I enjoy learning and have the patience to troubleshoot things if needed, so I continued using my computers with Linux hanging around occasionally breaking something.

Running my computer felt like dealing with a Brontosaurus: old, somewhat dim-witted and not designed for my living room. Powerful? Yes, but more "Oh no! It smashed through the wall again." than "Wow, look at what it is carrying!"
