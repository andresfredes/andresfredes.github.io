### What can you do?
<!--more-->

Cybersecurity is important to me. It is not only a passion driven by my own personal interest, but also a sense of responsibility based on my position. I am the go-to technical specialist for my family (immediate and wider) and my community. Outside of my work context, I am typically the most knowledgable person in the room about all things cyber and so I have a duty of care to protect those who aren't as aware of the dangers and safety measures. That brings us to this post: What can we do about it?

### At home
Most of our interactions with technology are through our phone and via web browsers and so, with that in mind, here are a few things that you can do to improve your security posture:
- **Use a password manager**: This isn't just about having a handy place to store your passwords, but more about being able to ensure that every login has a strong password that is not used anywhere else. If you are already using one, use this month as a reminder to update your most used and most important ones: social media, email, etc.
- **Add 2FA/MFA**: Multi-factor authentication makes a significant difference to the level of security of your important accounts. There are usually several options, but using an authenticator app (that generates 6-digit codes) is a common one that is accessible and better than email or text message alternatives. Websites may recommend a specific authenticator app to use, but they all share the same system. To keep things simple, choose one reputable authenticator app and use it for all websites.
- **Updates**: Check your phone's app store for any apps that need updating and do them all! Same for the operating system itself. When a bug or security flaw is discovered, it takes engineers a lot of effort to work out how to fix it. That fix then goes to waste if the update never reaches your phone.

### At work
Most workplaces have fairly clear security guidelines, but staff behaviour does not always match. There is a unfortunately common focus on the inconvenience of security measures. One way to reframe this is to consider that any workaround for a security measure essentially represents your willingness to shoulder additional cyber risk on behalf of your organisation in order for your own convenience. When dealing with cyber risks, it is hard to see the benefits of your actions as it is the combined action of the staff that makes for a security posture and if everything is going well there is nothing special to notice. Each little process done correctly is a win. If you are in any sort of role where others look to you (e.g. supervisor, trainer, mentor), this is all the more important as your actions are also helping shape those around you. This idea scales exponentially when in a role implementing or administrating security controls as your actions can shape other's without them even realising.

### Out in the world
Public Wifi and devices have layers of extra risks. If it is important to you, do it on a device and network that you trust.
There are people in your life who are not as equipped as you to make these changes themselves. Remind friends and family to update their devices and encourage them to use a password manager and enable 2FA. Each little step makes a difference, as attackers will go after easy targets. 

### Resources
If you are hacked and are not sure what to do, there is great advice to be found from the [Australian Cyber Security Centre](https://www.cyber.gov.au/).

Stay safe!
