### An obviously true statement with interesting ramifications.
<!--more-->

When thinking of a street map, it is easy for us to tell that the thing that we are looking at is a representation of an aspect of the real world - in this case streets. Where it becomes more difficult to tell the thing is a representation of an asepct of the world and not in fact reality itself is in regards to the maps we create in our minds.

For the sake of this post I will be using the word 'map' to mean any construction that is a representation of something else. Mental models, rules, heuristics, worldviews, the way things are... these are all other ways of describing the constructions in our minds that help us understand and navigate the complex world around us. 

Let's say I wanted to write down some guide to help a friend get from their house to mine. One simple approach could be to make a list of directions. It could have street names or landmarks as decision points, at which a relative direction change would also be indicated. Something like "Turn left at the first street after the pub". If I was feeling particularly artistic, I might instead draw a rough route with the decision points marked, and the directions implied by the drawn path. Both of these options are simple and in most cases would do the job.

Importantly, both the map and set of directions are very limited in what information they actually provide. They have just enough relavant information to be able to do the job. When viewed from the outside, they don't really contain much information at all about the real world.

The usefulness of a map is related to both the required relavant information being included and how little other information. Signal vs Noise. Including the name of every street between the two locations would only make the map less useful, despite becoming more accurate (in terms of relating to the real world).

The same idea holds true for the maps and models we have in our heads, but with a dangerous twist that gets people into trouble: we use our existing maps to navigate new situations. My friend would have a hard time getting to the post office using the directions to my house, so imagine the map issues from common generalisations: people I know -> everyone; my health -> someone else's; or my life -> yours.

**Everything** that we think we know is contained within our minds as a mental map of some kind or other. The map is not the territory. The things we think are not the truth, they are just the most useful framework we have to think about it, given our knowledge and experience. This should not be confused with thinking that it is all untrue, but rather that everything we understand has a certain amount of usefulness based on how good the map really is and how close the situation we are using it for matches what it actually maps.

Every so often, consider what you "know" about the subject at hand. How reliable is your map? Remember, the map is not the territory. If something about the world is surprising to you, double check whether your map needs to be updated.
