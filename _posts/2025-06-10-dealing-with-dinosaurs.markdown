The first thing that surprised me about looking after a [Deinonychus Antirrhopus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinonychus), cousin to the Velociraptor, was just how low maintenance it turned out to be.

But, before I get to that, lets talk about something much less exciting: Linux.

I am not a Linux enthusiast, despite how I may come across to the people around me. For a long time, Linux has just been the least objectionable choice in a fairly sad lineup of tools that allowed me to use a computer. My view of linux was:

### Pros:
- Doesn't try to sell me things
- Doesn't force me into technological walled gardens
- Doesn't watch, listen and record everything I do

### Cons:
- High effort
- Steep learning curve
- Random things break

The list of pros was not particularly inspiring, but rather a set of items that I felt should be the basis for any tool. Luckily, I enjoy learning and have a willingness to troubleshoot problems, so the cons were not a deal-breaker.

And so I used Linux.

Running my computer felt like having a pet Brontosaurus: old, somewhat dim-witted and not designed for my living room. Powerful? Yes, but more "Oh no! It smashed through the wall again." than "Wow, look at what it can do!"

For over a decade, my dinosaur wrangling skills have improved and these days I'm not overly bothered by the prospect of house-training another of these lumbering beasts. But the background issue still remains: why can't it arrive as a well mannered creature that is not a drama to keep inside the house? These issues were top of mind when I got my new laptop.

The laptop company recommended a few different breeds of Linux and one of these was entirely new to me. This brings us to the Deinonychus Antirrhopus named Bluefin.

Aside from the close relationship with the laptop manufacturer, this Bluefin had a few surprising features. Firstly, it defied the age-old Linux stereotype of putting all of the configuration choices in the hands of the user, up front. This was a sleek new Linux that did exactly what you wanted it to from the moment you get it home. It also looked after itself, by background-automating all of the essential updates - no more admin responsibilities. Lastly, it made it really easy to install applications. The fact this is even a surprising feature says something about the rest of the dinosaurs out there.

Essentially, Bluefin removed all of the cons from the list above while even adding a couple of pros! It got out of the way and just let me use my computer. Best of all, when I started using it I found that it has wallpapers of amazing dinosaur scenes that change from day to night based on the time of day.

Bluefin has been a welcome addition to my household.
