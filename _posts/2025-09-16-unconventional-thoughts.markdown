### What do you believe that most do not?
<!--more-->

This post started its life as a "Top 10" list, in which I presented ten, one-line summaries of ideas and beliefs I hold that I don't see to be held in the majority. From there I was going to discuss each in a bit more detail, to provide context for how I had come to each, and maybe even a little encouragement for you to consider your own position. This quickly started to unravel as I looked at my part-written post and couldn't help but see a reflection of the AI generated listacle that is one among many of the low-effort types of content that has been flooding the internet of late.

I write because I enjoy writing and I write publicly because I want to practice in a way that holds more accountability than if the words were all secreted away on my laptop. There is also always the chance that you may reply to this blog post with your own thoughts (email listed below), to which I am honour-bound to reply to. In any case, I do not write to engage with the 'attention economy' and so seeing even the smallest hint of association (even if unwarranted), drove me in a different direction.

So, let's start over.

### I like arguing.

I enjoy picking at the nuanced edges and grey areas that are an almost inevitable part of any held opinion. 

I have found that we all have a natural inclination to generalise, simplify and create mental models that explain the world and our experiences within it. This process is remarkably efficient, in that we can experience one or two cases of situation and immediately hold a strong belief about how the world works. This natural ability of ours allows us to quickly adapt to unfamiliar scenarios and learn new things quickly. Unfortunately, the patterns we see are so often wrong. Certainly not wrong in the sense of not being useful, but wrong in the sense of not truly being an accurate representation of the world. See [the map is not the territory](/2025/09/15/map-not-the-territory.html) for a bit more detail on this idea.

There are people who hold their beliefs as absolute, and are sometimes described as seeing the world as black and white. With that in mind, I tend to see everything in shades of grey. The differences in tone are important, darker and lighter greys are acknowledged as different, but the sense of absolute is not there. This has been the occasional trial for those around me, as there is often a caveat, exception or technicality to be noted. As a child, my friend said "From now on, just assume that everything I say finishes with '...not including Andres and his exception'"

This is a type of unconventional thought that I will call 'the nuance'. It is similar enough to the way the most people think that while people would agree, it may not be listed in their own mental map, either through ranking it low importance or rarely a consideration.

Another unconventional thought that I will call 'the experience gap', is one where a significantly different opinion is held. I have found that these come up due to very different bases of experience. A lay person having the opposite perspective to an expert is one example. Another is a different cultural belief coming from someone who grew up in a different country.

In a recent conversation with a friend, I mentioned a few of my 'unconventional thoughts' (this has been a topic of dicussion for me lately) and they commented that they agreed with most of them, and suspected that they weren't actually unconventional at all. I will double-down and keep this kind of unconventional thought listed anyway, and attempt to justify it with a couple of interesting situations where they can crop up. The first is due to siloing - if someone spends all their time with people who hold a belief, even if it is a very unconventional belief, it will appear to them as the majority. The second is around taboos or topics that for one reason or another, don't get regular discussion - people don't talk about it, so it may seem to not be held in the common mindset. I will sum these up as 'the illusion'.

The final one that I will mention here is similar to 'the experience gap' but it isn't clear what the actual difference in experience is. I will call this one 'the faith' as this kind of unconventional thought is often held in much the same way as relgious views.

Some questions to finish on:
### What do you believe that other people don't / won't talk about?
### What do you know as an expert, that lay people think the opposite?
### What do you think is an important caveat to a commonly held belief?
